# diff_drive_robot_ros2_demo
This repository contains step-by-step tutorials on how to setup a SLAM robot simulation using Gazebo and ROS 2.

# Branches Overview
The tutorials are organized in different branches in this repository. So, go ahead click the `main` button on the top-left corner of this page and check them out. These tutorials are in order.
1. `1-urdf`: building a simple differential driving robot model using the most basic **URDF**.
2. `2-xacro`: using **xacro** to clean up the model.
3. `3-physics`: adding physical properties to the model.
4. `4-gazebo_plain`: spawning the model in Gazebo.
5. `5-diff_drive`: adding Gazebo's differential drive plugin for ROS to the model.
6. `6-lidar`: setting up a simulated lidar.
7. `7-camera`: setting up a simulated camera.
8. `8-filtered_odom`: using `robot_localization` package to clean up robot's odometry.
9. `9-slam`: using `slam_toolbox` package for simultaneous localization and mapping.
10. `10-navigation`: using `nav2_bringup` package to navigate the robot.
